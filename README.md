# EARTH AND SUN
# 
This is a simple interactive or visual representation of the **Solar System**, including the Sun and the eight planets with their orbits. The project can be used for educational purposes or as a basic simulation in Python, JavaScript, or any other framework.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Sun and 8 planets with accurate relative distances and sizes (scaled)
- Planetary orbits and rotations
- Optional real-time simulation or animations
- Clean UI and easy-to-read code
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

📚 How It Works
Each planet's orbit and size are scaled down for visualization purposes. You can modify:

Speed of rotation

Planet details

Add moons, asteroids, etc.

---
Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structuring the content and layout of the project. 🧱

CSS3 for styling the planets, orbits, and other visual elements. 🎨

JavaScript for implementing interactive features, orbital calculations, and animations. 🚀🌟

---
✨ Future Improvements
Add planet moons

Add background stars

Use real-time API for planetary positions

Add sound or narration
